# AngularJS 1.x - ES6

This repository is origin copied from https://github.com/michaelbromley/angular-es6 which mainly approach using ES6 features for writing
AngularJS 1.x application (Just because I could not wait for Angular 2.x)

**Please see the article [Exploring ES6 Classes In AngularJS 1.x](http://www.michaelbromley.co.uk/blog/350/exploring-es6-classes-in-angularjs-1-x) for
a full explanation.**

## Build
 - 'npm install' for dependencies installing
 - 'grunt' for building source code (transpling from ES6 to ES5, then processing ng-Annotate
 -  You also need to install 'http-server', run 'npm install htt-server -g' for installing
 - The final source is located in 'build' folder
